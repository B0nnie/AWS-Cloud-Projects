A web-based resume written in HTML and styled with CSS, deployed as a static website on Amazon S3 with HTTPS security implemented via CloudFront. The webpage features a visitor counter, which utilizes  DynamoDB for data storage and retrieval and an API—built with AWS API HTTP Gateway and Lambda to communicate with the database. This project's infrastructure was defined using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) and is managed through this GitHub repository with a CI/CD pipeline for both back-end and front-end code.
